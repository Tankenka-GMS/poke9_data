# Pokémon data pack (for GPS Monster Scouter)

Here is the full source for the Pokémon data pack used in GPS Monster Scouter, minus the keys used to generate the pack.

The keys are kept private so that only the original author can create functioning updates to this pack.

You can suggest changes and fixes after working firsthand on it, and you can also use this as a base to create a different pack.

-------

If you try to create a pack using this source, remember that since you don't have the original author keys, you'll have to change the pack's ID.

In the first lines of the json file, you'll see this:
> "packName": "poke9_data"

Replace "poke9_data" with your new ID.

If you're using the testing keys from the [GMS Pack creation tools](http://gpsmonsterscouter.altervista.org/), you'll need to use a name that ends with "_testing_data".

Example: "dinosaur_testing_data"

P.s. don't distribute a pack generated with the testing keys, they're just for testing. When you're ready to release a pack, contact the game creator to receive your personal keys.
